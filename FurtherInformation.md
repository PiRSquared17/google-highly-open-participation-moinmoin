# Requirements #
Do not forget that you may only claim **one task at a time**.

It is **required** that you **create an account in the [main MoinMoin wiki](http://moinmo.in/)** and create a **homepage** there. You should **monitor it** for communication attempts by other persons. Also you should configure the Google Code Issues Tracker to send you **e-mails for newly added comments** to your task. This will ease communication between you and the core team.

If not specified differently, **all work has to be done on the [MoinMoin 1.6 branch](http://hg.moinmo.in/moin/1.6/)**. You will have to **provide a diff file** generated using "hg diff" or "hg export" (compare the Mercurial guide linked below) and attach it to the tracker.

If your task is not a coding related one and you are not told differently, the **deliverable is expected to be written down on the linked wiki page** and additionally attached to the tracker item here on the code.google.com site.

Documentation changes should usually occur on http://master.moinmo.in. Please read http://moinmo.in/EditingOnMoinMaster before editing any pages there.

All your work must be licensed as GPL v2 or a compatible license.

# Getting Help #

If you have signed up to complete a particular task and you have some questions about how best to complete it, first see if the task description has specific instructions about whom to contact for assistance. If there are no specific instructions in the task, these resources should be helpful to you:

  * **IRC Chat:** Representatives from the MoinMoin project will be hanging out in #moin-dev on irc.freenode.net to answer any questions you may have. If they don't know the answer, they will be happy to point you in the right direction.
  * **Group Site**: You can always ask questions on our [GHOP questions page](http://moinmo.in/GhopQuestions).

If you've looked for the answer but could not find any documentation or it was unclear please create a [bug report](http://moinmo.in/MoinMoinBugs) or [contribute to the documentation](http://moinmo.in/EditingOnMoinMaster) yourself so the community can continue to improve the information for everyone.

If you have a question not answered here that is related to contest mechanics, your best bet is to check out [the contest web page](http://code.google.com/opensource/ghop/2007-8) for more details.
