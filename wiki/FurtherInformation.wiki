If you have signed up to complete a particular task and you have some questions about how best to complete it, first see if the task description has specific instructions about whom to contact for assistance. If there are no specific instructions in the task, these resources should be helpful to you:

    * *IRC Chat:* Representatives from the !MoinMoin project will be hanging out in #moin-dev on irc.freenode.net to answer any questions you may have. If they don't know the answer, they will be happy to point you in the right direction.
